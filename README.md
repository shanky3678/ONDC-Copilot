# 📜 AI Compliance Assistant 🚀

## 📝 Brief About the Idea
Legal compliance is a complex and time-consuming problem. This gets worse as the company/startup scales and hampers the growth of the company.

Hence, we present our **AI Compliance Assistant**, a complete AI-based legal compliance solution that provides accurate compliance in minutes instead of days for platform companies.

## 🌟 Feature - Legal Eye
### 📸 Legal Eye
An image-based compliance calculating AI solution. This may be an image of a PDF or product label information, etc., and our Legal Eye gives a checklist of the compliant and non-compliant parts about it.
- With this, every product on the platform can be audited for compliance in minutes, 24x7, in an automated fashion.
- This also reduces the sale of shady products on the platform.
- New policy updates can be done with one click of a button, and the AI will be updated across the organization.

## 🖥️ User-Friendly Interface
The platform participants can be laymen trying to sell on the platform or buy on the platform. They do not understand legal complexities, leading to longer onboarding, longer sales processes, and frustrating experiences.

That’s why we built the **AI Compliance Assistant**. It will answer any legal query they have 24x7 in a simplified manner.

## 🌍 Ever-Changing and Complex Legal Landscape
The legal landscape is constantly changing, and traditionally the legal team needs to train all the relevant employees every time a policy is updated or changed.

Since LLM AI isn’t auto-updating, we built an **AI Legal Database** feature to tackle this part of the problem.

### 📚 AI Legal Database
It has 4 components:
1. **Powerful LLM AI**: To make a checklist and calculate the compliance for the data given.
2. **Advanced RAG System**: To overcome the limitations of Generative AI.
3. **Web Scrapers**: To scrape the data from official websites to update the database.
4. **Policy Update Feature**: Allows the company to upload their own policies to this database.

## 🔍 Our Unique Document RAG System for Compliance
Our team has created an expert **Retrieval Augmented Generation** system to work with unlimited documents while overcoming the limitations of LLM AI like inconsistency, hallucinations, and inaccuracy.

## 📈 Prototype Performance Report
This is still a **PROTOTYPE** so it is bound to improve with time and money. All the results here are from our testing.

- **Compliance Checklist Accuracy**: 90% - tested with 100 attempts to see if it missed out on any compliance checklist to look for in a given image. This is the easiest benchmark to improve upon.
- **Compliance Completeness**: ~86% on average when asked to give compliance requirements for a product sold in a particular state.
- **Failure to Give an Answer**: 2% of the times, when tested for 100 times.
