# ONDC-Copilot

ONDC-Copilot is a user-friendly interface that communicates with a backend API to provide seamless interaction with Co-pilot. It allows users to upload state rules, which are not available in the database, for document verification and processing. Uploaded documents undergo OCR for labeling processing and are stored in a RAG (Red, Amber, Green) system for enhanced performance. Users who upload documents and those who verify them earn points as rewards for their contributions to the platform.
